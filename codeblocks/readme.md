before running the script, make sure that code::blocks was previously run, 
	otherwise /home/christmas/.config/codeblocks/default.conf will not exist 
	(it is generated when code::blocks is first run)

give the script execution rights and run it

- then, on the left, select the color_theme.conf file from the ~/Desktop/ directory, 
	and on the right, default.conf from the /home/christmas/.config/codeblocks/ directory 
	(the standard path to the configuration file)
- then select the topics you need (I recommend selecting all)
- then click "Transfer >>" and click "Yes"
- then click "Save" and click "Yes"
- then click "Close"

Now run code::blocks and on the tab "Setting >> Editor >> Syntax highlighting" 
	and in the line "Color theme" you will see all the themes
